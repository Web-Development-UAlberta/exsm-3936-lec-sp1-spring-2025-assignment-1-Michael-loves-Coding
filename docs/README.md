# University of Alberta Browser Console Template Repository
## Full Stack Web Application Development Program
### This repository is intended for the development of console JavaScript applications.

Run `npm run lint` to attempt to detect errors in your repository.

Use `output()` and `await input()` from `./src/js/scripts.js` to allow the user to interact with the console.
To run the console, launch `./src/index.html`.

This repository contains code that runs, without requiring any action on the user's part, that shallowly simulates a car and its engine. Upon launching the console environment, code is executed that creates (instantiates) a car with an engine, and goes through a series of events that results in:

1. A car engine being created and simulated
2. The engine turning on 
3. Driving for 100 kilometers 
4. Turning the engine off
5. Turning the engine back on 
6. Driving for 50 kilometers 
7. Turning the engine back off
8. outputting / returning the odometer reading to the user 


All of this takes place without any input or information required from the user.
